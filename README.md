### Common Questions

- Why is everything licensed by Burnt Fen Creative LLC?

That is [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)'s shell company he uses for consulting services. Maintainer Mountaineer aims to some day be its own business, but for now, for licensing and invoicing purposes, Burnt Fen Creative is used.
