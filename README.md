## Common Questions

#### Why is everything licensed by Burnt Fen Creative LLC?

That is [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)'s shell company he uses for consulting services. Maintainer Mountaineer aims to some day be its own business, but for now, for licensing and invoicing purposes, Burnt Fen Creative is used. 

#### Why are there so many forks?

Maintainer.io policy is to fork repositories when we do public code and repository audits. If we have a fork here, that means we were contacted about auditing a repository. For Maintainer source repositories, you can see [this filter](https://github.com/mntnr?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=&type=source&language=) on the @mntnr page.

#### Can I haz stickers?

Yes! Send us an email or open an issue with your name and address, and we'll send a few out to you.
