# How To Run A Maintainathon

We've been trying something different over the past few months - running a Nock maintainathon every now and then. This is something like a Hackathon, but minus the overnighting. Basically, we synchronize our watches and meet up at a set date to work on something that needs to be done in Nock, in order to make the entire program better. This helps us get out of the weeds of dealing with support issues; helps the maintainers meet each other and hang out; and helps us cultivate a sense of community.

We've written several Medium posts on this process:

- [Maintain-a-thon for Nock](https://medium.com/nodenock/maintain-athon-for-nock-3a2a0fe982a9)
- [The Nock roadmap: Where we are, and where we are going](https://medium.com/nodenock/the-nock-roadmap-where-we-are-and-where-we-are-going-8844df218649?source=collection_home---6------1---------------------)
- [The Nock Maintainathon: Success!](https://medium.com/nodenock/the-nock-maintainathon-success-f0f5ae07457a)

Here, we want to lay out the specific checklist that should be done in order to set one of these up.

### Prerequisites

- A Twitter account with an active following. An email list will also do. You also need access to this account. We use [@nodenock](https://twitter.com/nodenock/).
- A Medium profile, or a blog. Ours is a shared publication [@nodenock](https://medium.com/nodenock)
- A GitHub repository, with push and pull rights.
- A Zoom account. This allows you to have longer video calls. Otherwise, use Google Hangouts or some free service for multi-person calls.

#### Other Good Stuff To Have

- A couple of maintainers. You can do this for a solo project, but it may not be ideal.
- A Twitch channel. This is helpful for broadcasting edits.
- A Gitter channel. We use this during the event to have syncronous chat as needed; really, though, Zoom seems to work.

## To Do

### Two Weeks Prior

- [ ] Create an issue suggesting a time for other maintainers. If you have a long-standing issue for community calls, comment in that.
- [ ] Pick a time.
- [ ] Set up a standing video call for that time, and post a public link to it.
- [ ] **Choose something to hack on.** Otherwise, you're just going to have to pick stuff, and you lose focus during the event.
- [ ] Write up a blog post, as needed, which you can then publicize elsewhere.
- [ ] Invite your friends at least a week before hand.
- [ ] Schedule some tweets using Buffer, or post them directly every few days about the upcoming event.
- [ ] Schedule a short call or email with other maintainers the night before to make sure that everything is ready.

### The Day Of

- [ ] Post in all channels that the event is happening in 30 minutes, on the day of the event.
- [ ] Show up to the event.
- [ ] End the event.
- [ ] Tell people the event is over, so no one is confused.
- [ ] Write up a summary.
- [ ] Try and close all work out - merge PRs during event, instead of later.
- [ ] Celebrate.

This list is meant to be a work in progress. We'll edit it and improve it as we go.
